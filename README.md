# The Little Prince — A Universe of Your Own

The Little Prince — both the short film and the novel — hold a special place in my heart. During a huge transition period of my life, I found both comfort and inspiration in the lessons of this story.

Every planet held great meaning for the layers of shedding that come with adulthood. Especially as a University of Waterloo Engineering student, it's easy to fall prey to what the planets represent: the need for control, the hunger for validation, the obsession with chasing numbers, the trap of blind obedience to rules you never chose. These are not just characters in a story — they are patterns. And recognising them is the first step to leaving them behind.

But in the midst of that recognition, the story quietly offers something else. The Fox teaches that meaning is not found — it is built, slowly, through the act of returning. *"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."* And the stars — once the Prince has gone — become personal to the pilot who knew him. No longer just distant lights, but proof that someone out there is laughing in one of them. That is what devoted attention does: it turns the ordinary into something irreplaceable.

This year, I wanted to let go of being hard on myself and simply show up — to immerse in habits without the weight of pressure or performance.

So I built this.

## How it works

Each planet in this universe represents a goal. When a daily habit is completed, a star is released into the sky. Over time, the sky fills — not as a metric, but as a memory. Every star is a day you chose yourself.

The rose is different. It belongs to no single goal. It lives on the asteroid, and it reflects the one thing that matters most: your relationship with yourself. It blooms when you show up. It wilts slightly when you don't. But it never dies. Just like self-love — it can always be revived.

The universe is also home to the six planets from the book — The King, The Vain Man, The Drunkard, The Businessman, The Lamplighter, The Geographer. They orbit quietly in the distance. You can visit them. The Little Prince will tell you what he remembers.
