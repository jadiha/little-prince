    lesson:
      'The King has no subjects, yet insists he rules the universe. He can only command what will happen anyway — the sun to set when it is already setting. His power is an illusion he has chosen to believe. When we chase control — over outcomes, over others, over how people see us — we often find ourselves as alone as the King, shouting into an empty sky.',

    lesson:
      'The Vain Man tips his hat to no one. He needs applause, but there is no audience. He has confused being seen with being known, and admiration with love. When we perform our lives for others — post, achieve, impress — we often become as alone as he is: applauding ourselves in an empty room.',

      'The Drunkard drinks to forget he is ashamed of drinking. It is the most honest portrait of any trap: the cure and the wound are the same thing. We all have versions of this — the scroll that soothes the anxiety the scrolling created, the distraction from the emptiness the distraction produced. The exit is always through, not around.',

      'The Lamplighter lights and extinguishes his lamp every minute, because orders were given long ago when the planet turned slowly. He cannot rest. He cannot stop. He is the only one the Prince found touching — because at least he is devoted to something beyond himself. But devotion without asking why becomes its own kind of prison.',

      'The Geographer has never seen his own mountains or oceans. He only records what explorers tell him. He considers flowers "ephemeral" — not worth mapping. He is the most dangerous trap for ambitious people: mistaking the map for the territory, the plan for the life, the knowledge for the wisdom. The Prince asked him about his planet. He had no idea.',

      '"I do not record flowers," said the geographer. "Why is that? The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet!" "Because flowers are ephemeral."',
